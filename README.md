## `flux_conventions`

This repository is a few small scripts and notebooks to reproduce the plots in a recent internal note about flux conventions in the IceCube Neutrino Sources working group. It is organized as follows:

* `central_energies`: Exploring how we quote the central energy ranges for our sensitivities
* `differential_sens`: Calculates differential sensitivities and model rejection factors
* `sensitivity_dip`: Explores features of short timescale analyses with a toy monte carlo
